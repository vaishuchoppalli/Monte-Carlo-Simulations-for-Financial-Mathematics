## Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique used to model and analyze complex systems or processes that involve uncertainty and probabilistic variables. It involves generating a large number of random samples or simulations using probability distributions to represent the uncertain variables in the system being modeled. The results of the simulations provide insights into the behavior of the system and help decision-makers evaluate risks and uncertainties associated with different courses of action. Monte Carlo simulation is widely used in finance, engineering, physics, economics, and other fields where complex systems or processes need to be analyzed under uncertain conditions.

## Course Content

Monte Carlo (MC) methods for accurate option pricing, hedging and risk management. Modeling using stochastic asset models (e.g. geometric Brownian motion) and parameter estimation. Stochastic models, including use of random number generators, random paths and discretization methods (e.g. Euler-Maruyama method), and variance reduction. Implementation using Matlab. Incorporation of the latest developments regarding MC methods and their uses in Finance.

## Homeworks

The homework assignments for the course are written in LaTeX, a high-quality document preparation system widely used in academia. In addition, the assignments may include code written in Python and MATLAB, as necessary, to demonstrate concepts and solve problems. Using LaTeX ensures that the documents are properly formatted, easy to read, and aesthetically pleasing, while including code snippets in Python and MATLAB adds a practical element to the assignments and enhances the learning experience.
